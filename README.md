# Day-in-the-Life-of-U
Day in the Life of U is the name for our product pitched in our Founder's Academy class, which is an entrepeneurship focused on teaching us how to create successful business models and inventions. For our product, we pitch an educational social media app focused on college students sharing insight to high schoolers on a program of interest at their college. We names it Day in the Life of U. It is not a fully-functional app, but this is the design for what our app would look like if we created it. The product were simply created to expand our knowledge of what it is like to plan for running a successful business. We received an A for in that class for our product.
